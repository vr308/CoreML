# The following is a Python translation of a MATLAB file originally written principally by Mike Tipping
# as part of his SparseBayes software library. Initially published on GitHub on July 21st, 2015.

# SB2_PARAMETERSETTINGS  User parameter initialisation for SPARSEBAYES
#
# SETTINGS = SB2_PARAMETERSETTINGS(parameter1, value1, parameter2, value2,...)
#
# OUTPUT ARGUMENTS:
# 
#    SETTINGS    An initialisation structure to pass to SPARSEBAYES
# 
# INPUT ARGUMENTS:
# 
#    Optional number of parameter-value pairs to specify    some, all, or
#    none of the following:
# 
#    BETA        (Gaussian) noise precision (inverse variance)
#    NOISESTD    (Gaussian) noise standard deviation
#    RELEVANT    Indices of columns of basis matrix to use at start-up
#    MU (WEIGHTS)        Corresponding vector of weights to RELEVANT
#    ALPHA        Corresponding vector of hyperparameter values to RELEVANT
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
#    SETTINGS = SB2_ParameterSettings('NoiseStd',0.1)
# 
# NOTES:
#
# 1.    If no input arguments are supplied, defaults (effectively an
#        empty structure) will be returned.
#
# 2.    If both BETA and NOISESTD are specified, BETA will take
#        precedence.
#
# 3.    RELEVANT may be specified without WEIGHTS or ALPHA (these will be
#        sensibly initialised later).    
# 
# 4.    If RELEVANT is specified, WEIGHTS may be specified also without ALPHA.
